               <h1>Article 1: Cameras</h1>
               <p>Whether it be a point and shoot or a DSLR getting a camera is one step to photography. Most people use their phones now and days, and thats 
               a good start. But if you're going to take this on as a hobby you should buy a camera. i would start off with a point and shoot then start my way 
               up to bigger cameras. You can buy these cameras at your local Target or Walmart.</p>

               <h1>Article 2: Finding Your  Style</h1>
               <p>When finding your type of style it all depends on you. There are many things you may photograph, and many ways you
               you can photograph the item or person. If riding in a helicopter or airplane and you enjoy the landscape you may 
               do aerial. The list may continue such as being artistic, commercial, events, or even modeling. The key to finding your style is to look
               at what you do best and what makes you smile when you take photos.</p>

               <h1>Article 3: Composition</h1>
               <p>Here are some guidelines in photography, but remember they're aren't rules.</p>
               <p>1.Rules of thirds - as shown above the rule of thirds is to help measure and keep things in balance and straight. You would you
               the rule by lining up the most important part of what you're taking a pictures of in between the intersecting lines.</p>
               <p>2.Leading Lines and symmetry</p>
               <p>When you take a picture with lines the view's eyes  will lead them across the whole photo. Using the lines may enhance the beauty of the photo.
               As well as the lines objects that make patterns will enhance the photo.</p>
               <p>3.Cropping</p>
               <p>When cropping an image you cancel the "noise" in the background. So that the viewers only see what you want them to see.</p>

               <h1>Article 4: Lighting and Angle</h1>
               <p>Lighting is key part of photography. When taking a picture your lighting must be exact. You can use the natural sun light to get the perfect light
               or buy the lighting lamps that are used in studios. Angles are important as lighting because you always want the subject to look good.</p>
